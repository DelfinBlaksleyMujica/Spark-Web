      <p>As global engagement hits historic lows and managers face growing pressure, the future of work hangs in the balance. 
      This post explores the root causes of workplace disconnection and how a more personalized, data-driven approach can help teams rebuild trust, motivation, and belonging.

Disengagement is estimated to cost the global economy over $438 billion per year in lost productivity, absenteeism, and turnover.
